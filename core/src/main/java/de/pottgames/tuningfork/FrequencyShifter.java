 * The frequency shifter is a single-sideband modulator, which translates all the component frequencies of the input signal by an equal amount. Unlike the pitch
 * shifter, which attempts to maintain harmonic relationships in the signal, the frequency shifter disrupts harmonic relationships and radically alters the
 * sonic qualities of the signal. Applications of the frequency shifter include the creation of bizarre distortion, phaser, stereo widening and rotating speaker
 * effects.
