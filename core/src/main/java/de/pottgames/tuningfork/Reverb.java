     * according to source-listener distance. It’s defined the same way as OpenAL’s Rolloff Factor, but operates on reverb sound instead of direct-path sound.
     * Setting the Room Rolloff Factor value to 1.0 specifies that the reflected sound will decay by 6 dB every time the distance doubles. Any value other than
     * 1.0 is equivalent to a scaling factor applied to the quantity specified by ((Source listener distance) - (Reference Distance)). Reference Distance is an
     * OpenAL source parameter that specifies the inner border for distance rolloff effects: if the source comes closer to the listener than the reference
     * distance, the direct-path sound isn’t increased as the source comes closer to the listener, and neither is the reflected sound. The default value of Room
     * Rolloff Factor is 0.0 because, by default, the Effects Extension reverb effect naturally manages the reflected sound level automatically for each sound
     * source to simulate the natural rolloff of reflected sound vs. distance in typical rooms. (Note that this isn’t the case if the source property flag
     * AL_AUXILIARY_SEND_FILTER_GAIN_AUTO is set to AL_FALSE) You can use Room Rolloff Factor as an option to automatic control so you can exaggerate or replace

     * This limit, when on, maintains a natural sounding reverberation decay by allowing you to increase the value of Decay Time without the risk of getting an
     * unnaturally long decay time at high frequencies. If this flag is set to AL_FALSE, high-frequency decay time isn’t automatically limited.
