 * The Automatic Gain Control effect performs the same task as a studio compressor – evening out the audio dynamic range of an input sound. This results in
 * audio exhibiting smaller variation in intensity between the loudest and quietest portions. The AGC Compressor will boost quieter portions of the audio, while
 * louder portions will stay the same or may even be reduced. The Compressor effect cannot be tweaked in depth – it can just be switched on and off.
