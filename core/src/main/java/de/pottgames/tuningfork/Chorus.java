/**
 * The chorus effect essentially replays the input audio accompanied by another slightly delayed version of the signal, creating a ‘doubling’ effect. This was
 * originally intended to emulate the effect of several musicians playing the same notes simultaneously, to create a thicker, more satisfying sound. To add some
 * variation to the effect, the delay time of the delayed versions of the input signal is modulated by an adjustable oscillating waveform. This causes subtle
 * shifts in the pitch of the delayed signals, emphasizing the thickening effect.
