# Introduction
TuningFork is a library for [libGDX](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx) that provides advanced audio features. The goal of this library is to make most of the features of [OpenAL](https://github.com/kcat/openal-soft) accessible and provide a comfortable, easy to use, low overhead and object oriented high-level API. Note that TuningFork is not an extension to libGDX audio but a replacement.

### Main Features
* Spatial audio (3D)
* Directional audio (3D)
* Normal audio (2D)
* Real-time effects such as Reverb, Echo, Flanger, Distortion (and many more)
* Filters
* HRTF support (aka binaural)
* Streaming is handled on a background thread
* No more fiddling with sound IDs - proper OOP design
* Load **wav**, **ogg**, **flac** or bring your own pcm data
* Supports surround sound formats
* Record audio
* Output to any sound device<br>(you are no longer tied to the default sound device)

### Limitations
* Lwjgl3 only, sorry mobile and web users
* **flac** files must not be in a **jar** file

### Why
The standard audio capabilities of libGDX are very limited compared to sound APIs like OpenAL - probably due to its cross-platform nature. Especially if you are developing a 3D application and want to create realistic spatial sound, use modern features like HRTF etc., you'll face some problems with libGDX. No more compromises for other platforms, no additional native dependencies, full power of OpenAL and a nice-to-work-with-API. This is what I have tried to implement here.

# Install
TuningFork is available via Jitpack.
First make sure you have Jitpack declared as repository in your root build.gradle file:
```groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```

Then add TuningFork as dependency in your core project: 

```groovy
project(":core") {
    dependencies {
    	...
        implementation 'com.github.Hangman:TuningFork:2.0.1'
    }
}
```
### Compatibility
Java 8 is required, make sure to set `sourceCompatibility = JavaLanguageVersion.of(8)` (or higher) in your gradle scripts.
| Version of libGDX   | Latest compatible version of TuningFork  |
|      :----:         | :---                                     |
| 1.9.11 - 1.11.0     | 2.0.1                                    |
| < 1.9.11            | not supported, might work though: 2.0.1  |
